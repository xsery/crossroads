## Gameplay
The player controls a side-scrolling mobile game featuring a ritualistic graphic style. The objective is Litch travel though Route 666, who moves continuously to the right, between obstacles and roles. If the player falls outside the tree trunk, game over. Lilly briefly jumps upward each time that the player taps the screen; if the screen is not tapped, Lilly falls because of gravity; each pair of trunks that she navigates between earns the player a single point, with potions awarded for the score at the end of the game.


## ART Concept

The character inspiration from an anime's  young witch on her mandatory year of independent life, finds fitting into a new community difficult while she supports herself by running an air courier service. She is thirteen-year-old trainee witch Kiki leaves home with her familiar spirit, a talking black cat named Jiji. She flies on her broomstick to the port city of Koriko.
